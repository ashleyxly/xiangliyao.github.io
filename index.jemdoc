== About Me
I am an Associate Professor (tenured) at [http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science] of [https://www.sjtu.edu.cn Shanghai Jiao Tong University]. I am also a faculty member of [http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/index_ch.html Intelligent Internet of Things] [http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/ (IIOT) Research Center]. I obtained my Ph.D. and master's degrees in [http://www.ece.utoronto.ca Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering] at [http://www.utoronto.ca University of Toronto], respectively in 2018 and 2015. My advisor is [http://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/ Prof. Baochun Li]. I received the B.S. degree from the [http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn Department of
Electronic Engineering] at [http://en.sjtu.edu.cn Shanghai Jiao Tong
University] in 2012.

My current research interests cover the intersected areas of security, privacy, machine learning, and mobile computing. Topics include data privacy, security and privacy in data mining and machine learning, intelligent edge computing, etc. Particularly, I am interested in identifying fundamental security and privacy threats in machine learning systems, and designing practical countermeasures.
